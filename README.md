**Project realistically offers a robust solution for extracting, processing, and presenting location-related information from images, with potential applications in travel, photography, 
and location-based services.**

A Python script leveraging PIL and piexif libraries extracts location and date-time from an image's metadata, gracefully handling errors. Geopy is employed to find a human-readable address using latitude and longitude coordinates via Nominatim reverse geocoding. For AI-generated images, a C2PA digital signature ensures unique identification. The dataset enriched with metadata is employed for training a landscape classification model categorizing features like hills and beaches. User-provided images undergo model scrutiny, leading to location recommendations based on recognized landscape features. This process enhances user experience by suggesting personalized destinations with comparable scenic attributes, creating a tailored travel recommendation list.
